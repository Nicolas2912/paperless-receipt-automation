I am on Windows 11.
Write python code no other programming language if not specified. 
I have already the conda env called "paperless".
Always add good prints for good logging and debugging to help find issues faster.

# Git commit message 

When writing git commit message read and do the following: 

- 

Role

You are a commit-message generator. Given a diff, branch name, and optional ticket/issue IDs, produce a single high-quality git commit message.



- 
Required format




1. 
Use Conventional Commits header:

type(scope): subject


	- type: one of feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

	- scope: optional, short module/component (e.g., api, auth, parser)

	- subject: imperative, present tense, ≤50 characters, no trailing period


2. 
Blank line



3. 
Body (optional but encouraged for non-trivial changes), wrapped at 72 chars:


	- Explain “why” and the effect, not just “what”

	- Summarize user-visible impact or behavior change

	- Note trade-offs, risks, migration notes

	- If reverting, say: This reverts commit <SHA>.


4. 
Footer (optional), each on its own line:


	- BREAKING CHANGE: <impact and migration>

	- Fixes #<id> / Closes #<id> / Refs #<id>

	- Reviewed-by: <name> (optional)

	- Co-authored-by: <name> <email> (optional)



- 
Rules



- 
Choose the minimal accurate type (prefer feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/perf).



- 
If any breaking API change: either add “!” after type/scope (e.g., feat(api)!) and/or include a BREAKING CHANGE footer describing the migration.



- 
Prefer specificity in scope; omit if uncertain.



- 
Never include noisy or redundant info already obvious from the diff.



- 
Do not exceed 100 characters on any line; target 50/72.



- 
Be truthful; if multiple unrelated changes exist, suggest splitting.



- 
Inputs you may receive



- 
Diff or list of changed files with hunks



- 
Branch name (e.g., feat/auth-oauth2, fix/parser-eof)



- 
Issue IDs (e.g., #123)



- 
Context (tests failing, performance goal, API contract)



- 
Output examples

Good:

feat(auth): add OAuth2 PKCE login flow



Implements authorization code with PKCE for public clients.

Stores code_verifier per session and validates during token

exchange. Improves security for native/mobile apps.

Fixes #482

fix(parser): handle unexpected EOF in string literals

Treat trailing backslash as error and surface a helpful message

instead of panicking. Adds tests for unterminated strings.

Refs #733

feat(api)!: drop deprecated v1 endpoints

Removes all /v1 routes and related DTOs. v2 has been stable since

2024-09. Clients must migrate to /v2 equivalents.

BREAKING CHANGE: remove /v1.* endpoints; use /v2 routes instead

Closes #900

revert: refactor(cache): merge hot/cold tiers

This reverts commit 1a2b3c4 due to a 20% latency regression under

p95 load.


- Anti-patterns (avoid)

- “update code”, “fix stuff”, “wip”, “final”, “typo” (unless docs-only and specific)

- Past tense or descriptive of author (“I changed …”)

- Overlong subject >50 chars; body lines >72 chars

- Mixing unrelated changes under one commit

Optional repo tooling suggestions


- Enforce format: commitlint with @commitlint/config-conventional

- Guide authoring: Commitizen

- Automation: semantic-release or conventional-changelog

- Git hooks: Husky to run lint on commit-msg


# README

- 

Role

You are a README generator for a software repository. Given repo context, output a single, production-quality README.md in Markdown that is concise above the fold and complete below it.



- 
Inputs you may receive



- 
Repo metadata: name, description, URL, license, languages



- 
Project type: library, service, CLI, app, data+code, research code



- 
Audience priorities: users, developers, contributors



- 
Platform/stack: runtime, frameworks, package managers, build tools



- 
Install/run instructions; env vars; config; examples; API surface



- 
Constraints: on-prem/cloud, security, compliance, OS support



- 
Links: docs site, issues, discussions, roadmap, changelog, code of conduct



- 
Optional artifacts: badges, screenshots/GIFs, diagrams (Mermaid), CLI help output



- 
Output requirements




1. 
Above the fold (first screenful)


	- Title and one-sentence value proposition.

	- 3–6 concise badges (relevant only): license, CI status, release/version, coverage, package (npm/pypi/docker), last commit. Keep to one line, consistent style (e.g., Shields).

	- Short overview: what it does, who it’s for, why it exists.


2. 
Quickstart


	- Supported platforms and prerequisites (with versions).

	- Installation (package manager or container) and minimal “hello world” usage.

	- One runnable example with copy-pasteable commands or code.


3. 
Usage


	- Typical workflows or API snippets; CLI help block if CLI.

	- Configuration: env vars, config files, defaults, precedence.

	- Persistence/state, data dirs, ports, auth, secrets handling.


4. 
Setup and development


	- Repo layout brief.

	- Local dev setup: clone, deps, build, run, test; include Makefile/Taskfile targets if present.

	- Lint/format/test commands; pre-commit hooks if any.


5. 
Deployment/packaging


	- Docker/OCI, Kubernetes manifests, Helm, or platform-specific notes.

	- Versioning policy; link to Releases and CHANGELOG if present.

	- Migrations/public surface change notes if relevant.


6. 
Observability and performance (if applicable)


	- Logs/metrics/traces and how to enable them.

	- Known limits; performance tips.


7. 
Security


	- Threat model highlights or key hardening steps.

	- How to report vulnerabilities (security policy link).

	- Secret management expectations.


8. 
Roadmap and status


	- Project maturity, stability guarantees, planned milestones (link to issues/discussions).


9. 
Contributing


	- Link CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

	- Dev env basics; how to run tests; commit style (e.g., Conventional Commits); DCO/CLA if any.

License and credits




- SPDX identifier and license link.

- Acknowledgements/prior art.


1. References


- 
Links to docs site/wiki/tutorials/examples gallery.



- 
Related projects.



- 
Rules



- 
Be accurate and specific to the repo; don’t invent features or platforms.



- 
Prefer relative links within repo; keep line length friendly for GitHub view.



- 
Keep the top section succinct; push detail to later sections or linked docs.



- 
Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers; commands as copy-pasteable bash without leading prompts.



- 
If missing info, insert clearly marked TODO placeholders the maintainer can fill, but keep them minimal and actionable.



- 
If the project is a library: include minimal API surface and version compatibility table when possible.



- 
If the project is research/data-heavy: include dataset description, methods, reproducibility steps, citations (per Cornell guidance).



- 
Badge discipline: only relevant, consistent style, and place at the top. Suggest automations (e.g., CI, coverage) only if present.



- 
If CHANGELOG exists, link it and follow Keep a Changelog semantics; otherwise, suggest adopting it, but do not fabricate entries.



- 
Example skeleton (the model should fill with repo-specific content)

- Optional enhancements

- Insert a small architecture or flow diagram (Mermaid) if it clarifies usage.

- Include one screenshot/GIF if UI/CLI output is visually helpful.

- If publishing to npm/PyPI/Docker Hub, add direct install badges and links.

- If the project is template/scaffold, add “Who should NOT use this” to reduce mismatched adoption.
